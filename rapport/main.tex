\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
\noindent
The Kuramoto Model (Yoshki Kuramoto) is a mathematical model that describes the syncronization of coupled oscillators. This program is based on this model to describe a set of 2D-coupled oscillators in various cases. In particular to reproduce data obtained in the case of the coupled arrays of Josephson junctions \cite{josephson}. This program was edited for the last time the 10/29/2020. It was written in python 3 under ubuntu. There are 6 files. The first one is the main file, \mintinline{shell}{main.py}, it is the only one you have to execute, you could have to comment or uncomment some lines. Instead of that you just have to edit one file, the settings file, \mintinline{shell}{settings.py} where you can find all the settings. Then you have the kuramoto file, \mintinline{shell}{kuramoto.py}, where you can find the \py{class KuramotoModel} which contains all the functions related to the model or the verifications. The data file, \mintinline{shell}{data.py}, contains the \py{class Data}, which is used to manage data. The graphs file, \mintinline{shell}{graphs.py}, with the \py{class Graphs} manages the display of the results. And the integrator file, \mintinline{shell}{integrator.py}, where you can find the \py{class Integration}, which contains the three integrators : Euler, RK2, RK4. There is also the parameters directory which is important to save data. You can find all these files on \href{https://github.com/faucheresse/swimming_pool/tree/main/prog}{github}.
\section{Functional requirement of the program}
\label{sec:2}
\noindent
All the functions used for the computing or to display of the results are called in the main file. At first there are the functions which create the initial values in respect of the parameters, then these values are stored in data files (.dat) in a directory named "parameters". With these data files, we don't have to repeat the calculations every time we want to test something. Then you have the functions that compute the results (the phase of the oscillators, the complex mean average, and the Shannon entropy), wich are stored in data files in the same directory. And finally there are the functions that display the graphs using the module \py{matplotlib.pyplot}. In this section we will describe the functions that create the data files and their data. Firstly, initial data are created throught the \py{class Data} wich is in the data file. Finally the computing of the other values is in the \py{class KuramotoModel} wich is in the kuramoto file.
\subsection{The initialisation of data}
\label{subs:2.1}
The initial data are created by the function: \py{data.init_data(state)}. You can choose if you want to create new initial data by changing the value of \py{newData} to \py{True}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.3\linewidth}} \toprule
            \multicolumn{3}{c}{\py{data.init_data(state="random")}}\\
            \midrule
            \hfil Description & \hfil Input & \hfil Output\\
            \cmidrule(r){1-1} \cmidrule{2-2} \cmidrule(l){3-3}
           
            This function is used to create the initial values, stored in data files, according to the value of the argument \py{state} set by default to \py{state="random"}. You can create data for random, chimera, inverse, or josephson states. &
            The argument \py{state} is a \py{string}. By default it takes the value \py{"random"} but you can give it these values:\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=15pt]
            \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
            \item \py{"random"}
            \item \py{"chimera"}
            \item \py{"inverse"}
            \item \py{"josephson"}
            \end{itemize}
            & This function will retrieve six data files in the parameters directory, computing in according to the \py{state} argument.
            The data files are: \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=15pt, itemsep=0pt]
            \item \py{"omega.dat"}
            \item \py{"theta0.dat"}
            \item \py{"K.dat"}
            \item \py{"eta.dat"}
            \item \py{"alpha.dat"}
            \item \py{"tau.dat"}
            \end{itemize}\\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{function data.init\_data()}
    \label{tab:init_data}
\end{table}\\
Each \py{state} creates six variables, which are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
        \item $\omega$ is a list of real of size N. It contains the natural oscillations of each oscillators
        \item $\theta_0$ is a list of real of size N. It contains the intial phase of each oscillators. So at the time $t=0$
        \item $K$ is a matrix of real of size N$\times$N. It contains the coupling coefficients between each oscillators depending on the nearest neighbours. The nearest neighbour of an oscillator are defined by M in the settings file. It is set as $30\%$ of the total number of oscillators, you can change it
        \item $\alpha$ is a matrix of real of size N$\times$N. It is the dephasing matrix of the coupling
        \item $\tau$ is a matrix of real of size N$\times$N. It is the delay matrix
        \item $\eta$ is a matrix of real of size N$\times$T. It is the representations of external noises for each oscillators at each time $t\in ]0, T[$
\end{itemize}
They are different for each state, you can see their definitions in the tables \ref{tab:states1} and \ref{tab:states2}. The function \py{uniform()} is from the module \py{random}, and provide random real numbers with uniform distribution, in the range given. The function \py{randint()} do the same things with integers.

\end{table}
\newpage
\noindent
For each \py{state} choosen you have to define in the settings file the parameters \py{Nr} and \py{Nc}, to define the geometry of the system. \py{Nr} define the number of rows and \py{Nc} the number of columms, so \py{N=Nr*Nc} is the number of oscillators. For example if you choose \py{N=12} in the geometry \py{Nr=3, Nc=4}, you will have this configuration:\\
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/os_table.pdf}
    \caption{Configuration of the oscillators for \py{Nr=3, Nc=4}}
    \label{fig:os_table}
\end{figure}\\
\noindent
The labels in the Figure are the labels of the oscillators. If you put a non-positive number the program will not work. So be careful to respect the physics of the system.
\subsection{The computing functions}
\label{subs:2.2}
\noindent
There are three computing functions imported from the \py{class KuramotoModel}, by the object \py{kuramoto}. You can choose if you want to compute new data by changing the value of \py{newData} to \py{True}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.3\linewidth}} \toprule
            \multicolumn{3}{c}{\py{kuramoto.integrate(f, theta0, tf=100, integrator="RK4")}}\\

            \cmidrule(r){1-1} \cmidrule{2-2} \cmidrule(l){3-3}
           
            This function integrates the function \py{f}, with the initial vector \py{theta0} during a time \py{tf}, set by default to \py{tf=100} with 1000 values(T), using the integrator, set by default to \py{integrator="RK4"}&\vspace*{-8pt}
            \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=15pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=0pt]
                \item \py{f} is the function to integrate such that $f:\real^n  \rightarrow  \real^n$
                \item \py{theta0} is the initial vector, such that $\theta_0 \in    \real^n$. It is a list of real of size N
                \item \py{tf} is the duration of the integration. Set to 100 by default. It is an integer
                \item \py{integrator} is the integrator that you want to choose. It can take only these values: \py{"Euler"}, \py{"RK2"}, \py{"RK4"}. Among the three integrators, RK4 is the one losing the least energy the longer the integration lasts, therefore it is the default value.
            \end{itemize}
            & This function will retrieve two data files.
            \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=15pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=0pt]
                \item \py{"theta.dat"} : contains a matrix of real of size N$\times$T. It is used like a list of vectors. Each vector contains the phase of each oscillators at one time, labeled in the same way as the \autoref{fig:os_table}. So the matrix represent the evolution over time of this vector.
                \item \py{"t.dat"} : contains a list of real of size T, defined by \py{linspace(0, tf, T)}. \py{linspace()} is a method from \py{numpy}.

            This function computes the orders parameters $R$ and $\Phi$, of the $\theta^i$ over time, by the relation : $R\e^{\i\Phi} = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}\e^{\i\theta^i}$, for one time.&
            There are no arguments to this function because it takes only data files. It takes the theta file and the t file, see \autoref{tab:integrate}.

                \item \py{"phi.dat"} : It contains a list of real of size T. \py{phi} represents the complex mean of angles of the $\theta^i$ over time.

\end{table}
\noindent
To summarize in the main file there are 4 functions that are called for the computing. The first one is for initializing data according to the state choosed by the user. The following three are here to compute the main data by using the Kuramoto model. You can choose if you want to initialize new data (\ref{tab:init_data}) or do a new computing (\ref{tab:integrate}, \ref{tab:orders} \& \ref{tab:shannon}) by modifying the logical variables (\py{newData}, \py{newComputing}) in the settings file. In this file you can modify the \py{state} variable (\ref{tab:states1} \& \ref{tab:states2}). You can also modify the geometry of the system by changing \py{Nr} and \py{Nc}, don't forget to redo the initial data and the computing after that. Be careful not to set the number of rows or columns to a negative or zero number, it would not make any sense. If you want to save or use other files than the predifined ones you can modify it in the dictionnary \py{FILE}. You don't have to modify anything else that is not in the settings file. Be careful if you want to modify it, because you can break the program. For the rest of the main file there are 12 functions that are here to display the results. The last three are here to create gifs, they are the begining of the gold version. These displaying functions will be explained later.

\section{Internal structure of the program}
\label{sec:3}
\subsection{Description of the physical model}
\label{subs:3.1}
In this program we had to describe 2D-coupled oscillators and tried to reproduce known results \cite{josephson}. So we will use the Kuramoto Model. Proposed by Yoshiki Kuramoto this model is used to describe the syncronization of a large set of coupled oscillators. It is a mathematical model and we are going to use it in this form :
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:kuramoto}
    \dot{\theta}^i(t)=\omega_ i + \dfrac{1}{N}\sum^{N-1}_{j=0}K_{ij}\,sin(\theta^j(t-\tau_{ij})-\theta^i(t)+\alpha_{ij}) + \eta_i(t)
\end{equation}
where :
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item $\dot{\theta^i}(t)$ represents the varation of the phase of the i-th oscillator over time.
\item $\omega_i$ represents the natural frequency of the i-th oscillator.
\item $N$ is the total number of oscillators in the system.
\item $K_{ij}$ is the coupling matrix. It represents the coupling between each oscillators depending on the inverse of the physical distance between them. Sometimes you can consider only the nearest neighbour.
\item $\theta^i$ is the phase of the i-th oscillator.
\item $\tau_{ij}$ is the delay matrix. It is to take into account the phase propagation of the oscillators which have an influence on the i-th oscillator.
\item $\alpha_{ij}$ is the dephasing matrix. It represents the dephasing due of the coupled oscillators.
\item $\eta_i(t)$ represents the influence of the environement, the possible external noises.
\end{itemize}
As you can see this model is pretty complete. The formula is the sum of all the influences due to the environment and the nearest coupled oscillators at a given time. That why it was chosen to build $\theta$ like a list of vectors.
\subsection{Desciption of the used scientific computation algorithms}
\label{subs:3.2}
During the computation we used 3 algorithm for integration of the kuramoto model \ref{subs:3.1}, the Euler, RK2 and RK4 algorithm. But you can choose the one that you want to use. It is recommended to use the RK4 method because it loses less energy over time than the others, so it is more accurate. Otherwise if you want less computing time it is a good thing to try other. You can find all these integrators in the \py{class Integration}.\\
We are looking to integrate $\dot{\theta} = f(\theta)$.\\
Let $\theta\in\real^n$ and $f:\real^n  \rightarrow  \real^n$. We will note $\theta^i$ the i-th component of $\theta$ and $\theta_n$ the vector $\theta$ at the time $t_n$, $\theta_n \equiv \theta(t_n)$. So we have $\theta^i_n$ the i-th component at a time $t_n$ of $\theta$.\\
The Euler and Runge-Kutta methods are integrators of first-order differential equations and are based on the definition of the derivative:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:derivative}
    \begin{aligned}
        \dot{\theta}(t_n) &= \dfrac{\theta(t_n + h) - \theta(t_n)}{h}\simeq\dfrac{\theta_{n+1} - \theta{n}}{\Delta t}\\
        \iff \theta_{n+1} &= \theta_n + \dot{\theta}(t_n)\Delta t = \theta_n + f(\theta_n)\Delta t
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t = \frac{T}{N_t}$ the step of the simulation ($N_t\in\intg$ the number of steps of the simulation and $T$ the time of the simulation). We need $\Delta t$ sufficiently small so $N_t$ enought large and $T$ sufficiently thin.
\subsubsection{Euler's method}
\label{subsubs:Euler}
The Euler algorithm is directly an application of the \autoref{eq:derivative}:
\begin{equation}
    \theta_{n+1} = \theta_n + f(\theta_n)\Delta t
\end{equation}
This method will diverge quicker than the two other but the computing time is the shortest.
\newpage
\subsubsection{RK2 method}
\label{subsubs:RK2}
The Runge-Kutta algorithm (RK2) is like the Euler's method but with a double use of the \autoref{eq:derivative}. There is a middle step to tweak the estimation of $f$.
\begin{equation}
    \theta_{n+1} = \theta_n + f(\theta_n + f(\theta_n)\dfrac{\Delta t}{2})\Delta t
\end{equation}
This method will diverge quicker than the RK4 method and slower than the Euler's method. Its computing time will be longer than the one of the Euler's method but remains shorter than the one of RK4 method.
\subsubsection{RK4 method}
\label{subsubs:RK4}
RK4, the fourth order Runge-kutta algorithm, is similar to the RK2 algorithm but with a tweak around the middle point.
\begin{equation}
    \theta_{n+1} = \theta_n + (K_{1,n} + 2K_{2,n} + 2K_{3,n} + K_{4,n}\,)\frac{\Delta t}{6}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        K_{1,n} &= f\,\left(\theta_n\right)\\
        K_{2,n} &= f\,\left(\theta_n + K_{1,n}\,\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\\
        K_{3,n} &= f\,\left(\theta_n + K_{2,n}\,\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\\
        K_{4,n} &= f\,\left(\theta_n + K_{3,n}\,\Delta t\right)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Even if this is the slowest method of three orders of the Runge-Kutta algorithm, it is the most accurate one.\\
You can find all this algorithm in the \py{class Integration}.
\subsection{List of the constitutive elements of the program}
\label{subs:3.3}
The Program includes 4 classes. There are 3 that are used in the main file and 1 in the \py{class KuramotoModel}, see \autoref{fig:diagram_classes}. 
\subsubsection{The \py{class Integration}}
\label{subsubs:integr}
This class doesn't have any attributes. It is just used to store the integrators. It can be used in an other program just by writting \py{import integrator} at the begining of you code, and create an object with the class. This class uses the module \py{numpy}. Here is a table of the class:

\subsection{Functional diagram of the program}
\label{subs:3.4}
The program is cut out in 6 modules: main, graphs, kuramoto, data, integrator, and settings. You can see how they interact with each other in the following figure:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/packages_kuramotoModel.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the interactions between the modules.}
    \label{fig:diagram_module}
\end{figure}\\
In these modules data, integrator graphs and kuramoto contain a class. These classes are depending to each other like in the following diagram:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/classes_kuramotoModel.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the dependences of the classes.}
    \label{fig:diagram_classes}
\end{figure}\\
The previous diagrams has been created using \mintinline{shell}{pyreverse} in the directory with the programmation files. The full command used is : \mintinline{shell}{pyreverse -o png main *.py}. That create two pngs, one for the connections between the classes and one for the inetractions between the modules.

\section{Quality approach, reliability of the program}
\label{sec:4}
\subsection{Optimization of the code}
\label{subs:4.1}
In a process to limit the memory usage by heavy arrays and reduce computing time, it has been decided to store these arrays in data files (for example \autoref{tab:init_data}) while waiting for their use. So arrays doesn't takes up memory space between their use. In a quality and time approach, 3 integrators have been used and you can choose the one that you want depending on the quality and the time you want, see \autoref{subs:3.2}. During the execution of the program you can see the running time of the computing functions, see the following example (\py{N=3*4, state="chimera"}) :
\begin{minted}{shell}
----- init data -----
running time : 0.0090s
----- integrate RK4 -----
running time : 8.7955s
----- orders -----
running time : 0.0463s
----- Shannon entropy -----
running time : 0.9747s
\end{minted}
\subsection{Code verifications}
\label{subs:4.2}
Code verifications has been made for the three computing fuctions, \autoref{subs:2.2}. We have plot graphs corresponding and compare them with the expected results in the choosen configuration. The \py{function dens_kuramoto()}, the \py{function orders()} and the \py{function shannon_entropies()} were also used to verify the resullts. We have tested the case of N independant identical harmonic oscillators (abbreviate in Niiho), i.e. $\omega^i = 1$, $\theta_0^i = 1$, $\eta = 0$ and $K^i_j = 0$. We have also used the \py{function graph_connectivity()} to see connections between oscillators.\\
So after computing we have these graphs :

        \label{subfig:connect}
    \end{subfigure}
\caption{Niiho case}

\end{figure}
\newpage
\noindent
We can see in the \autoref{subfig:kuramoto} phases are totaly independent, identical and act periodically. The \autoref{subfig:mag} and \autoref{subfig:phase} show us that oscillators are identical and harmonic. And the \autoref{subfig:shannon} and \autoref{subfig:connect} prove the oscillators are independant. With the simple case of Niiho we can see the program retrives results corresponding to the expected results, so the program works correctly.
\section{Outcome examples}
\label{sec:5} 
In this section we will see two outcome examples with \py{state="chimera"} and \py{state="josephson"}. The graphs, the gifs and their data could be find in the corresponding directory in the "outcomes" directory.
\subsection{Chimera state}
\label{subs:chimera}
The chimera state is defined according to the document \cite{chimera}. I have choosen the case of the quantum chimera state. A chimera is a (meta)stable state of a system of coupled oscillators in which an ordered coherent phase and a disordered incoherent phase coexist, without the disorder contaminating the whole in a short period of time or becoming completely ordered. We can verify this definition using the densities graph of the phase and the Shannon entropy with $N=3\time4$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth]{../outcomes/chimera_2D/dens_kuramoto.png}
    \caption{\py{Density of phase of quantum chimera state}}
    \label{fig:dens_phase}
\end{figure}
\newpage

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth]{../outcomes/chimera_2D/dens_shannon.png}
    \caption{density of Shannon entropy of quantum chimera state}
    \label{fig:dens_shannon}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Using \autoref{fig:dens_phase} and \autoref{fig:dens_shannon} we can see groups of oscillators coexisting in ordered coherent phase and disordered incoherent phase, without the disorder contaminating the whole in a short period of time or becoming completely ordered.
\subsection{Josephson arrays}
\label{subs:josephson}
In the case of Josephson arrays we want to compare our results to an article \cite{josephson}. So we are using the same initial data that they used, see \autoref{tab:states2} with $N=10\times10$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{../outcomes/josephson/mag.png}
    \caption{\py{Complex mean of magnitude in josephson arrays}}
    \label{fig:mag_j}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{../outcomes/josephson/phase.png}
    \caption{Complex mean of phase josephson arrays}
    \label{fig:phase_j}
\end{figure}
\noindent
We can see that in the two last figures the curves are well shaped, there is no noises or few. That mean the oscillators are locking between them, according to the article. The oscillators seems to work together therefore the fact that the oscillators don't have the same natural frequency and the same initial conditions. So the magnitude describe a quasi incoherence state. They seems to work together but with a wave-shape mouvement.
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, this program describes a set of 2D-coupled oscillators using the model of the mathematician Yoshiki Kuramoto. It will return several graphs to study in detail each case, gifs and data file, you can find them all in the outcomes directory. You can also add new initial set of data tu study other case. For example you can try to represent the case of self-synchronization and verify your predictions.
